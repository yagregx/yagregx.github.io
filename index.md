Hello! I’m Yage ([/jakɤ/]({% link _posts/2025-08-31-On the matter of names, part 1.md %}), or "yah-kuh" where the "k" is unaspirated) and I am a 4th year undergrad at UC San Diego, majoring in Linguistics and Cognitive Science. (and minoring in Music!) 

My [research interests](/research/) mostly involve how people use language (to think and communicate) in diverse contexts. Specifically, I like to work on things like pragmatics in autism (and how theory of mind/egocentricity is/isn’t involved), as well as other areas that intersects with psychology and cognitive science, such as the psycholinguistics in bilingualism, and some “not-so-linguisticky” topics like aphantasia or (absolute) pitch perception. I am also starting to explore some computational approaches/tools. I believe that we can’t fully understand language and cognition unless we understand the language and minds in different groups across various situations. 

Outside of academics, I am passionate about music and [art](https://www.instagram.com/mobigreus/), as well as reading and writing. There are a bunch of topics that I particularly care about, including disability rights, theology & philosophy, and anthropology. 

#### Where am I & What I'm up to: 

- August 2025 till now: Back to San Diego working on research and vacationing and soon school :)
- July 2025: Excited to be at the LSA 2025 Institute at U of Oregon, with the support from the Warren Cowgill Fellowship!
