You might be suprised how easy it is to mess up a name with 7 (or 8) letters, yet here I am with a fresh new addition to the list: Apparently my first name, when spelled out loud (Y-A-G-E), can be misheard as Yhee (Y-H-E-E), even though I tried hard and said that my name is "Ya-guh", not "Yee". (And for some reason, the person also spelled my last name as "Shin", even though I said it's X-I-N.)
